## üöÄ How to Play

1.  **Setup:**
    *   **MIDI Keyboard (Recommended):**
        *   Connect your MIDI keyboard to your computer.
        *   Click the "Connect MIDI" button.
        *   Allow MIDI access if prompted by your browser. The status message will confirm connection.
    *   **Computer Keyboard:**
        *   If no MIDI device is connected or you prefer, you can use your computer keyboard. Default mappings for the C4 octave and C5 are shown on the virtual keyboard keys.

2.  **Choose Mode:**
    *   **Game Mode (Default):** Click "Start Game" to begin at Level 1.
        *   Notes will fall. Press the correct key as the *bottom edge* of the falling bar aligns with the **HIT LINE** inside the **HIT ZONE**.
        *   Accuracy (Perfect, Great, Good) determines your score and combo.
        *   Missed notes or incorrectly timed presses (in Game Mode) cost a life.
        *   The game ends when you run out of lives.
    *   **Free Play Mode:** Select "Free Play".
        *   Choose a scale from the "Practice Scale" dropdown.
        *   Click "Start Game". Notes from the selected scale will fall at a relaxed pace.
        *   Focus on hitting the right notes without scoring or life penalties. Excellent for learning scales and keyboard layout.

3.  **Controls:**
    *   **Connect MIDI:** Attempts to connect to an available MIDI input device.
