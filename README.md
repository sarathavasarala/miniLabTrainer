## How to Play

1.  **Setup:**
    *   **MIDI Keyboard (Recommended):**
        *   Connect your MIDI keyboard to your computer.
        *   Click the "Connect MIDI" button in the game.
        *   Allow MIDI access if prompted by your browser. The status message will confirm connection.
    *   **Computer Keyboard:**
        *   You can also play using your computer keyboard. The following keys map to the C4 octave:
            *   White Keys (C4-B4): `A`, `S`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `J`
            *   Black Keys (C#4-A#4): `W`, `E`, `T`, `Y`, `U`

2.  **Gameplay:**
    *   Click "Start Game".
    *   Bars representing notes will begin to fall from the top of the screen, corresponding to different keys on the virtual keyboard.
    *   When the bottom edge of a falling bar aligns with the top edge of its corresponding key on the virtual keyboard, press the correct key on your MIDI or computer keyboard.
    *   Your score and combo will increase with accurate hits.
    *   If a bar passes the alignment point for its key without being hit correctly, you lose a life.
    *   The game ends when you run out of lives.
